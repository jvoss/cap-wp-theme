# Civil Air Patrol WordPress Theme

This template is from National Headquarter's [Branding Resource Guide](https://www.gocivilairpatrol.com/members/cap-national-hq/public-affairs-about/resource-library/toolkit/branding-resource-guide)
website template created by Global Reach.

A special "Thank you" to Maj Robert Bowden, CAP from GLR on his contributions 
to converting the template to WordPress. 

I have continued his work by adding several enhancements that I hope will make 
the administration of the site more friendly to those less familiar with PHP or 
HTML.
